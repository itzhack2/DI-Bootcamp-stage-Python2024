# Using the input function, ask the user for a string. The string must be 10 characters long.
# If it’s less than 10 characters, print a message which states “string not long enough”.
# If it’s more than 10 characters, print a message which states “string too long”.
# If it’s 10 characters, print a message which states “perfect string” and continue the exercise.
# Then, print the first and last characters of the given text.
# Using a for loop, construct the string character by character: Print the first character, then the second, then the third, until the full string is printed. For example:

# user_input = input("Enter a string of exactly 10 characters: ")

# if len(user_input) < 10:
#     print("String not long enough.")
# elif len(user_input) > 10:
#     print("String too long.")
# else:
#     print("Perfect string.")

#     first_character = user_input[0]
#     last_character = user_input[-1]

    # print("First character:", first_character)
    # print("Last character:", last_character)
# for character in user_input:
#     print(character)
